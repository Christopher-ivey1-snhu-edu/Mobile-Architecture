1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
///The weight tracker app was designed to help users enter in a daily, weekly or monthly weight into a database, that is stored on the app that will send notifications to the user when they reach a desired goal weight.


2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

///To make this design more successful with user needs in mind, it is important to make sure the app is working properly. As well as being easy to use. The UI needs to be easy to read and everything needs to be positioned in uniform. The screens must be navigatable and connect to each other by callback methods.


4. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
///I first researched similar apps that were successful and seen how they ran there application Then thought logically on what could be improved. I analyzed different users and what they would like to use the app for.

6. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
///I am still working on improving my app so that the functionality is working properly. This process is very important, because it reveals that I need to spend alot more time developing code and working to create a functional application for a user to interact with. 

8. Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

//The whole project was an innovation growth challenge for me. This is something that is completely new to me and I need to spend more time on this. The design process of the project and using the emulator is very intriguging. I am particularly successful in demonstrating that an app can be updated and made better after getting more knowledge and experience.
